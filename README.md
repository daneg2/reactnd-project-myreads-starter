# MyReads Project

This project allows you to searh for books you would like to add to your library and shelf them according to three categories: Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read. 

## To use this library right away:
* Install all the dev dependencies with npm
* Run the program with the 'npm start' command and then the React App will open in your browser
* You start off with and empty library with three shelves: Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read
* To add to your library, go to the search page to search for books based on titles or authors
* Once you've searched and some books have popped up, you can add the books to your library by selecting a shelf for it. If you select none, it means the book has not been shelved yet and will thus not appear
* If you've selected a shelf, you can go back to the library and your book should now lie on the shelf you selected
* Feel free to move your books around by selecting a different shelf or remove a book by selecting the shelf as "None"

## Enjoy!
